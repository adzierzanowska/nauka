    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/248159/pexels-photo-248159.jpeg">
    <p>I'm 25 years old and I love traveling. I graduated with Bachelors degree in Asian Studies, but somehow it wasn't satisfying enough that's why I'm still searching for my place in this world and for something that I will feel really passionate about.</p>

    <p>I was learning Chinese for 3 years while studying in University, and Korean for a year. I love photography since I was 7 years old, I even wanted to work as a photographer for either National Geographic or some fashion magazine. I love animals, and right now I have 3 Shih-tzu in my house.
